# Object Walker

## About

This is the start of a re-implemetnation of the "valutwalker" code made for CSDCO 
into a generic tool for taking file systems or object stores and building ot the 
associated initial Schema.org based data graph for them.

It follows the RDA inspired Digital Object pattern and is designed from the start
to work with FAIR Digital Object patterns.
